# Mot.Integration.Services
This is a .NET Core inplementation of the original MOT Gateway Interface libraries in the Interface Repository.  It's much faster and portable to Windows, Linux, and macOS.  Unlike the original Interface repository, there are no UI samples. There is however a complete service based implementation that provides the complete system functionality for both TCP/IP, Filesystem, and SQL Server targets.

All future interface development will be done using this repository.  Several key elements will be added over time including:

* WebAPI for Configuration Management and Monitoring
* Mobile Device UI for Same
* motNext direct REST API for Bi-directional Integrations
